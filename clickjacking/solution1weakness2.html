  <p>One of the things restricted by the sandbox attribute is navigation. A sandboxed iframe may not change top.location.</p>

  <p>So we can add the iframe with sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms". That would relax the restrictions, permitting scripts and forms. But we omit allow-top-navigation so that changing top.location is forbidden.</p>

  <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms" src="solution1iframe.html">
